#### 4. Innovative Idea

An app to find runners on the same route and time. There are lots of runners who want to have a running buddy so that they can be motivated and consistent with their exercise. However, each runner has a different running route, speed, and schedule, and it is difficult to find a person who fits all of those criteria. On our platform, people post their running route, speed, schedule, and some information about themselves, and after the process, they get connected to multiple profiles who have similar routes and schedules. If runners select each others, they are directly sent to a group chat room or they can choose to direct private message. This application and its idea can also be expanded to other exercises such as biking, hiking, etc.
