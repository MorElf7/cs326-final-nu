When user press match, it will trigger a Create operation that create a new match request

![](./img/matchSuggestion_update.png)
When user accept or decline a match request, an Update operation will be triggered and update the status of the specific match request.

When the user hit unmatch, the specified match request will be delete from the database.

All of the above page has Read operation to fetch the data to display for the user.

When user click 'â™¥', the information of the liked user will get sent to the database and check if it is a match. Alert will be triggered to notify user that they clicked 'like'. The new suggested user will be rendered on the match deck.
